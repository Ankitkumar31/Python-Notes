# History Of Python
![Guido Van Rossum](https://gvanrossum.github.io/images/guido-headshot-2019.jpg)
- Python was conceived in late 1980s by <mark> Guido Van Rossum </mark> at centrum Wiskunde & Informatica in netherlands as a successor of ABC language.

- He was been invariably worked as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018.

- In January 2019, active python core developers elected a five member council to lead the project.

# Version History of Python

- python 1.0 ===> 1994
- python 2.0 ===> 2000
- python 3.0 ===> 2008

> Note: Latest version 3.13.3

```
General format : 
   
   Major . Minor .Micro

eg.    3.13.3 version.
```
* Micro: <br> It change means nothing is updated but the current version all bugs and error resolve.

* Minor: <br> It change means some new feature is added or current updated.

* Major: <br> It change means changing the desing. Means old version code not work here . 

# Features Of Python 

- simple and straight forward syntax.
- Case sensitive
- Multi-paradigm programming language.<br>
{ Guide line to write code for eg. C++ use object oriented paradigm etc.}
- Dynamically typed { Automatically detect which type of variable after looking stored value does not requires to specifies type like C,C++,Java}
- Emphasis on code readability { by default indentation you have to keep in mind.}

# Development

- Conception:  Van Rossum conceived Python in the late 1980s as a hobby Project.
- Implementation:  Van Rossum began implementing Python in December 1989.
- Release: Van Rossum publicly release Python in 1994.
- Maintenance: The <mark>Python Software Foundation  (PSF) </mark> maintain Python.
- In 2016 popularity started to grow up.
- In 2011 Google made first AI & ML based library.

# Python 

- It is a high level, general prupose , interpreted, open source programming language created by Guido Van Rossum at CWI in Netherlands and first released in 1991.

- It is widely used in Automation & AI because of : 

    a. Easy to understand.<br>
    b. Less coding time.

- It was named python on the basis of comedy show <mark>'Monty Python's Flying Circus'</mark>
- It is relatively slower than C/C++/Java language.
- We may download python installer from official website <mark>'www.python.org'</mark>
- In 2006 Python change its old logo to new traditional logo.

# About Guido Van Rossum

- CWI in Netherlands there he was doing its Job.
- Python was his second language. He made ABC language for other company.

# How this language is going to introduced to world?

- In 2001 he made its own organization where he uploaded python. <br>
Company name => PSA { Python Software Foundation}

# Interpreter:

Interpreter is work as a translator which is use for converting high level language into Machine language/ low level language.

- low level (understand by machine) Binary) {0 or 1}
- High level (understand by Humans) {ABC....,abc....,1,2,3...}

# Components Of Python Installer 

1. Interpreter
2. IDLE (Intergreted Development & Learning Environment)
    - It is default python editor by PSF.
    - We may also use other 3rd party editors like (VS code, Anaconda, spyder,...etc.)
* Python library is the collection of function.

* Python file extenshion.

3. Documentation (docs) : 
    - It is a official document by PSF containing all technical and non-technical features of python.
4. Standard library : 
    - also known as core python library.
    - created and maintained by PSF and distributed as part of installer.
    - Collection of predefine codes.
5. Pip command: 
    - It is used to download & install 3rd party libs.
    - We need internet connection to install these library.
