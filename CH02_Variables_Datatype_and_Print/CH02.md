# Chapter 2 : Variable , Data Type and Print()

```
Note: In this chapter you'll learn about the different kinds of data you can work with in your python programs.
You'll also learn how to use variables to represent data in your programs and also benefits of IDE's Also.
```
# Benefits Of IDE's : 

- Let's takes a close look at what Python does when you run <mark>hello_world.py.</mark>

`hello_world.py         print("hello python world!")`<br><br>
` output:   Hello Python world! `

- When you run the file hello_world.py, the ending(.py) indicates that the file is python program.
- As you write your programs, your editor highlights different parts of your program in different ways. For example , it recognizes that <mark> print() </mark> is the name of a function and displays that word in one color.
- It recognizes that "Hello world!" is not python code and displays that phrase in a differnt color. 

- This feature is called <mark> syntax highlighting.</mark> and it quite useful as you start to write your own program.

# Variables In Python 

- Variables are used to hold data during execution of the program.
- Variables as labels that you can assign to values . You can also says that a variable references a certain value.
- In C, C++ you need to declare variables only after declaration you can use them. eg.

```
int a = 13
float b = 14.5 
char c  = 'A'
```
- <mark>In python you don't declare variables.</mark> If there is a need of a variable you think of names and start using it as a variable. Eg. 

```
->  a = 11
->  b = 13.5
->  c = 'hello world!'
->  d = True
->  e = None
```
``` 
* hello_world.py      
                
        message = "hello Python World!
        print(message)

output => 
            Hello Python World!
```

- Here we added a variable named message. Every variabale is connected to a value , which is the information associated with that variable.
- In this case the value is the " Hello Python World!" text.

# Naming And Using variables { Variables Name Rules}

- When you're using variables in python , you need to follow few rules and Guidelines.

- Breaking some of these rules will cause errors, other guidelines just help you write code that's easier to read and understand.

1. Variable names can only contain<mark> letters, numbers , and underscore. {abc..,ABC..,123....,_}</mark>

2. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number . For example : 
```
     message_1                --> NO Error 
     _message1                --> No Error
     1_message                --> Error
```
3. Space are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to seperate words in variable names. For eg. 

```
greeting_message         # No error underscore assume as space.
greetin message           # Throw error space not allowed in variable.
```
4. Avoid using python keywords and function names as variable names.<br>
For example , do not use the word print as a variable name. Python has reserved it for a particular programmatic purpose.

5. Variable names should be short but descriptive. For example , name is better than n , student_name is better than s_n and name_length is better than length_of_persons_name.

# Avoiding Name Error When Using Variables

a. Although good programmers might create errors, they also know how to responds to those error eficiently.
Let's look at an error you're likely to make early on and learn how to fix it . 

b. We'll write some code that generate an error on pupose. Enter the following code, including th misspelled word mesage, which is shown in bold: 

```
message = "Hello Python"
print(mesage)
```
c. When an error occurs in your program, the python interpreter does its best to you figure out where3 the problem is. <br>
The interpreter provides a <mark>traceback</mark> when a program cannot run successfully.

* Traceback:
`A traceback is a record of when the interpreter ran into trouble when trying to execute your code.`

Here is the example of the traceback that python provides after you've accidentally misspelled a variable's name:

```
Traceback(most recent call last):
 File "hello_world.py", line 2 , in <module>
 print(mesage)

Name error: name 'mesage' is not defined . Did you mean: 'message'?
```
d. The output reprts that an error occurs in line 2 of the file hello_world.py <br>
The interpreter shows this line 2 to help us spot he error quickly and tells us what kind of error it found.

## Name Error

A name error usually means we either forgot to set a variable's value before using it, or we made a spelling mistake when entering the variable's name.<br>
If Python find a variable name that's similar to the one it doesn't recognize , it will ask if that's the name you meant to use.

# Predefin Function type()

- type() is a predefined function which return the data type of a specified variable.

- type() is used to find the type of variable in python. Example:
```
a = 12
print(type(a))
```
# Data Type in python

![Datatype Tree](https://images.theengineeringprojects.com/image/main/2020/06/Datatypes-in-python.jpg)

1. Numeric type ->  int , float , complex
2. Sequence type ->string , tuple , list.
3. Mapping type -> Dict
4. Boolean -> True , False
5. Set type -> sets , frozen set
6. Binary type -> bytes , bytes array, memory view.


Int:
- numeber without fraction. eg .5.-12,0,etc.
- range depends on memory(Ram), maximum (2^63-1) Example:
```
a =12
b = -13
c = 0 
```
float:
- number with fraction. eg. 5.5,0.0,-9.4 etc.
- 308 digits we can show in fraction part. example : (3.234456.......till 308 number)
- 15 to 17 decimal places, maximum 308 after this it become infinite.

Example :
```
a,b,c, = 8.4,0.5,-7.9
print(a,b,c)
```
string(str):
- sequence of characters (alphabets, digits,symbols, space, etc)
- Ther are 4 type to write a string: 
```
i. Write with single quote eg. <br>
(' ............  ') or  print('hello world!')

ii. writing with double quote. eg.
("..........") or print("hello world")

iii. writing with tripple quote . eg.
('''...............''') or print(''' hello world''')

iv. Writing with tripple quote wiht double eg. 
(""".......""") or print(""" hello world!""")
```
> NOTE:
> 1. Triple quote strings are useful to write multiline text.
> 2. str does not support sing (-/+) and calculator.

## Questions

```
Question: Print the address of user?

address = "VPO Sunderpur"
print(address)
```
```
Question: Print python with double quote?

print("PYTHON")
```
```
Question: Write string in multiple line?

print(''' hello every 
one my name isn
Ankit kumar''')
```
> NOTE: here we wan't to write the message in multiple line then we use tripple line quote or triple double line quoter.

# Integers and Floats: 

- When you devide any two numbers, even if they are intergers that result in a whole number, you will always get a float. Example : 

4/2
output => 2.0

- If  you mix an interger and a float in any other operation, you'll get a float as well:
```
a. 1 + 2.0 
output =  3.0

b.  2 * 3.0
output = 6.0

c. 3.0 ** 2
output = 9.0
```
- python defaults to float in any opertion that uses a float , even if the output is a whole number.

# Escape Sequence Character In String

1. Escape sequence character is represented by backslash (" \ ") along wiht a character.

2. escape sequences have special meaning in string.
3. python provide following escape sequences character : 

```
i. \n  ---> New line in output.
ii. \t ---> tabspace in output.
iii. \u ---> unicode char in output.
etc.
```
```
print("Ankit\nhello\t Goodmorning.")

output: 
        ankit
        hello
                Goodmorning.
```
4. <mark>Escape sequence throw error when you try to use integer or float in it.</mark>

```
Question: Try to show output \n,\t,in you string code?

- to solve this question we have 2 formulas : 

i. For that you have to use one more backslash (\\) in the place of single slash (\). for eg.

print('ab\\ncd\\t')
output:  
        ab\ncd\t
```
* <mark> Use this when you wan't to print some of escape sequence not all.</mark>

ii. Second method :

* prefix means before the content.
* surfix means after the content.
```
- user raw string (strin prfix with r)

exampel : 
                print(r'av\ncd\tef')
        output:
                av\ncd\tef
```

* <mark>Use this method when we  aggre that all sequence character will be printed.</mark>

```
Question : Write a program to print following output: 

Sonu  Monu
Ajay  Vijay

Ans. 
        print("Sonu \t Monu \n Ajay \t Vijay")
output:
        Sonu    Monu
        Ajay    Vijay
```

* Second Method: 

```
print(""" Sonu  Monu
Ajay    Vijay""")

output:
        Sonu    Monu
        Ajay    Vijay
```
# print() Function

- If we wan't to print multiple value with the help of print() example : <br>
          ``` 
          print(10,20,30)
           output: 
           10,20,30```

- If you want to give me multiple value you have to use (,) in seperation and it can be mixed example: 
```
print(10,'hi',3.5)

output: 
        10 hi 3.5
```
- If we want to use multiple print in single line : 

` print('hi');  print('Ankit');`

- It is a library function that write values of any data type to standard output. 
- it may accept 0-N values.

```
print(*args, sep=' ',end='\n', file = None, flush = False)
```
### i. Seprator(sep):

- it is a keyword argument of print that works btw 2 values not after last.
- it default value is space and we may also change it.
Example: 

```
print("Ankit","kapil","Jatin",sep='*')

output: 
        Ankit*kapil*Jatin
```
### end:

- It is another keyword argument of print that work after the last value only.
- It's default value is '\n' and we can also chage it.
```
 print("Ankit","kapil","jatin", end='&')

 output - > 
                Ankit , kapil,jatin&
```
# Constants: 
- A Constant is a variable whose value stays the same throughout the life of a program. 
- Python does not have built-in constant types but python programmers use all capital letters to indicate a variable should be treated as a constant and never be chaged. 
example : 
Max_Connections = 5000

- When you wan't to treat a variable as a constant in your code. Write the name of the variable in all the capital letter.
