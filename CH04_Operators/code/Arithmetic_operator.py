# Arithmetic operator: 
a = 11 
b = 3
print(a+b)
print(a-b) # here sequence matters. Changing of position can change result.
print(a/b) # here sequence matters. Changing of position can change result.
print(a*b)

print(a//b) 
# it is hide the point value and show round off, of that value.
# here sequence matters. Changing of position can change result.

# NOTE:
#  if you wan't correct value then use true division.
#  if you want round of that value then use flore division.

#eg.

print(10//3) 
print(10/3)

print(a%b) 
# it will show the remainder value.
# here sequence matters. Changing of position can change result.
print(10%3)

print(3**2)
 # Answer will be power of that.
# here sequence matters. Changing of position can change result.
